# ecallen
Python package for retrieval and analysis of data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. Includes routines to interact with the Allen's API, download images, basic image processing, and provides fast 3D registration to the Common Coordinate Framework. The essential features are illustrated in the figure below:

## Installation

Clone the repository. Add the ecallen directory to your Python path and import as you normally would.

```Python
# add ecallen package to Python path temporarily
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/path/to/ecallen")

# import the "image" module from the ecallen package
from ecallen import images as ecimg

```

## Usage

### Retrieve image IDs

```Python

""" Use ecallen to retrieve all image_ids for an experiment """

from ecallen import images as ecimg

section_data_set_id = 531477700
all_image_ids = ecimg.get_all_section_image_ids(section_data_set_id)

print("Section Image IDs: ", all_image_ids)

Section Image IDs:  [531477716, 531477704, 531477708, 531477806, 531477718, 531477765, 531477843, 531477755, 531477787, 531477853, 531477789, 531477733, 531477739]

```


### Image Download

```Python

""" Use ecallen.image to download a single image """

from ecallen import images as ecimg

# save a single section image
section_image_id = 531477777
ecimg.save_section_image(section_image_id, 'sample_image.jpg')

# load the saved file and plot
from skimage.io import imread
img = imread('sample_image.jpg')
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
ax.imshow(img)
plt.show()

```

### Retrieve image metadata

```Python
""" Use ecallen to retrieve image metadata """

from ecallen import images as ecimg

section_data_set_id = 531477700
params = ecimg.get_imaging_params(section_data_set_id)

params

{'blue_channel': 'tdTomato',
 'genotype': 'Npr3-IRES2-Cre;Ai14-231439',
 'green_channel': 'tdTomato',
 'is_FISH': False,
 'is_ISH': True,
 'plane_of_section': 'coronal',
 'red_channel': 'tdTomato',
 'section_thickness': 25.0}
```

### Neuron segmentation

`ecallen` accomplishes neuron segmentation by applying Otsu's threshold to each image. The routines can deal flexibly with ISH and FISH images.

```Python
""" Use ecallen.images to identify neurons in raw images """

from ecallen import images as ecimg
import numpy as np

# open a raw image
img_path = '/path/to/image/datasetID_167643437_imageID_167643532.jpg'
section_dataset_id = 167643437

# grab the RNA probes from the imaging parameters
img_params = ecimg.get_imaging_params(section_dataset_id)

# run the segmentation function
rprops = ecimg.extract_region_props(img_path,
                                    section_dataset_id,
                                    img_params['probes'],
                                    )

# grab the X and Y pixels at the center of each labeled region
cell_x_pix = np.array([roi['centroid'][1] for roi in rprops])
cell_y_pix = np.array([roi['centroid'][0] for roi in rprops])

```

### Fast 3D registration

`ecallen` registration routines transform each neurons' location from X,Y space into real "brain space" coordinates. `ecallen` accomplishes fast image registration by implementing affine transformations locally instead of relying on point-by-point registration via the Allen's API. Thus, thousands of points can be registered in seconds, enabling large scale analyses.

```Python
""" Fast 3D registration with ecallen.images """

# define the image and brain IDs
section_dataset_id = 167643437
section_image_id = 308604373

# use ecallen for registration to PIR coordinates
pir = ecimg.xy_to_pir(cell_x_pix,
                      cell_y_pix,
                      section_dataset_id,
                      section_image_id
                      )

```

__Figure 5:__ ecallen provides fast image registration for large scale analyses. Here, roughly 124,000 neurons from 44 images have been registered to the common coordinate framework. Each dot is a single neuron and different colors indicate different raw images. In this case, raw images were coronal brain slices. ecallen's registration routines transform each neurons' location from X,Y space into real "brain space" coordinates.
